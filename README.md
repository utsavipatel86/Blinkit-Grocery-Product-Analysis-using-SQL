# SQL-BlinkIt-Project

Blinkit is a reputed online grocery store that uses MySQL to analyze
their data and make informed, data-driven decisions. By leveraging
MySQL, they track sales trends, analyze customer behavior, and
identify areas for improvement. For instance, they analyze sales data
for a particular product category or compare sales figures across
different outlets to identify areas where they need to focus their
efforts to increase sales.

In our Case study Blinkit: Grocery Product Analysis, we have a table
named 'Grocery Sales' with 12 columns including Item_Identifier,
Item_Weight, Item_Fat_Content, Item_Visibility, Item_Type,
Item_MRP, Outlet_Identifier, Outlet_Establishment_Year, Outlet_Size,
Outlet_Location_Type, Outlet_Type and Item_Outlet_Sales. This table
contains data on the sales of various grocery items across different
outlets of Blinkit.
